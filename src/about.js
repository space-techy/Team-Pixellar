          Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is the space agency of
          India. The organisation is involved in science, engineering and
          technology to harvest the benefits of outer space for India and the
          mankind. ISRO is a major constituent of the Department of Space (DOS),
          Government of India. The department executes the Indian Space
          Programme primarily through various Centres or units within ISRO.

          ISRO was previously the Indian National Committee for Space Research
          (INCOSPAR), set up by the Government of India in 1962, as envisioned
          by Dr. VikramA Sarabhai. ISRO was formed on August 15, 1969 and
          superseded INCOSPAR with an expanded role to harness space technology.
          DOS was set up and ISRO was brought under DOS in 1972.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The prime objective of ISRO/DOS is the development and application of
          space technology for various national needs. To fulfil this objective,
          ISRO has established major space systemsfor communication, television
          broadcasting and meteorological services; resources monitoring and
          management; space-based navigation services. ISRO has developed
          satellite launch vehicles, PSLV and GSLV, to place the satellites in
          the required orbits. Alongside its technological advancement, ISRO
          contributes to science and science education in the country. Various
          dedicated research centres and autonomous institutions for remote
          sensing, astronomy and astrophysics, atmospheric sciences and space
          sciences in general function under the aegis of Department of Space.
          ISRO's own Lunar and interplanetary missions along with other
          scientific projects encourage and promote science education, apart
          from providing valuable data to the scientific community which in turn
          enriches science.

          ISRO has its headquarters in Bengaluru. Its activities are spread
          across various centres and units. Launch Vehicles are built at
          VikramSarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), Thiruvananthapuram; Satellites are
          designed and developed at U R Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), Bengalure;
          Integration and launching of satellites and launch vehicles are
          carried out from Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), Sriharikota;
          Development of liquid stages including cryogenic stage is carried out
          at Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), Valiamala& Bengaluru;
          Sensors for Communication and Remote Sensing satellites and
          application aspects of the space technology are taken up at Space
          Applications Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad and Remote Sensing satellite data
          reception processing and dissemination is entrusted to National Remote
          Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The activities of ISRO are guided by its Chairman, who would also be
          the secretary of DOS and Chairman of Space commission – the apex body
          that formulates the policies and overseas the implementation of the
          Indian Space Programme.
